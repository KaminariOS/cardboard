#  A simple VR game that shoots ball to hit the target, based on the google Cardboard sample scene

## Scene path
Assets/Samples/Google\ Cardboard\ XR\ Plugin\ for\ Unity/1.25.0/Hello\ Cardboard/Scenes/HelloCardboard.unity

## Game mechanics

In the room, there is an object that changes its geometry and teleports to another position from time to time. The player can click the screen to shoot balls to the object. Once the object gets hit, it teleports to another random position and the player gets one score.

## Why it is a game?

First, the scene has rules, which is encoded by the physics engine and scripts. Second, the game is challenging, which means the player has to actively find a solutions to the target. Third, the player will only play the game for fun, not for money or anything else. 


## TODO

Add a text UI to display to show the score on the screen. For some unknown reason, the text is not shown at the moment.
